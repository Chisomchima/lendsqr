## Usage

Now that the installation is complete, let's dive into the usage of the Project:

1. Run the application: `yarn dev`
2. Access the Project in your browser at [http://localhost:3000]
3. The home Page shows three Links namely the Login, Dashboard and User.
4. Access each page on the assignment using these links.

## File Structure

The file structure of this Project is organized as follows:

Lendsqr/
â”œâ”€â”€ Pages/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ index/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ login/

â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
|â”€â”€ styles/
|â”€â”€ Service/
|â”€â”€ types/

- `Pages/`: Contains the main pages of the application.
- `public/`: Includes public assets such as images, fonts, and static files.
- `Service`: Includes the api requests as well as the local storage data caching for user details.
- `styles`: Houses all styling leveraging scss.
- `components`: All basic page components are placed in the components folder such as table component, cards etc.
- `types`: Houses the UerData interface that was used in populating the table component and details page.


## Features

Thes features were implemented along with the UI:

1. **Pagination**: [I implemented the pagination feature for seamless data viewing]
2. **Rows Per Page**: [For the same reasons as stated in pagination, I had to implement the rows per page functionality ]
3. ** Filters **: [A functional filter that allows easy filtering in the application was implemented]

## Deployment

I used the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
to deploy the application.
